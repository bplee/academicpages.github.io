Hey there, glad you made it! My name is Brennan, I am a second year MS student at Weill Cornell Medical College, pursuing a degree in computational biology. In undergrad I pursued a major in Math with Computer Science, as well as a minor in bio, but felt the desire to pursue my interests to the next level. Currently, I am a graduate researcher in the Leslie Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Research Center, where I work on Bayesian inference techniques and modeling under uncertainty.

Aside from being a student, I enjoy roller blading, a teaching and practicing a traditional Korean martial art, and producing music.
